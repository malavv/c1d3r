## [2.1.0] - 2016-09-22
### Added Value
All version > 2.0 are now programmed using the new Polymer framework. This will allow for better fluidity, speed, and greater compatibility. Furthermore, the UI as gotten a full rework from the ground up, no more confusing datasheets. There is also more guidance around the central recipe (dry hard cider) instead of having different levels of guidance around a few (not ready yet) recipes.

### Breaking Changes
Most guide variables kept the same or similar names.

### Migration
Data coming out of pre-2.0 version will have to be re-entered manually.
