          C1d3r is an interactive *hard* cider brewing guide. It aims at providing simple and easy to follow instructions meant for beginners and seasoned cider makers alike. As opposed to a written guide, C1d3r allows you to factors in certain parameters and which will then impact the quantities and steps that are produced.

        <p>
          This project is meant to be simple and straight to the point. It offers flexibility but only based on pre-existing recipes. This is therefore not meant to be a generic recipe maker, nor a brewing simulator. Other products are much better at doing this. The core of the C1d3r application is its set of curated recipes. It will always have a custom mode, that allows some basic calculation to be done, but it is not it's intended use case.
